# URLSpringWeb

In this Java code snippet, I created a URLController class that handles the URL shortening functionality for a Spring web application. Let's go through the code and understand its implementation.

The URLController class is annotated with @RestController, indicating that it is responsible for handling RESTful API requests and generating appropriate responses. It consists of various methods for URL manipulation.

The generateShortURL() method is annotated with @PostMapping and receives a longURL as a request body. It generates a shortURL based on the provided longURL. The method checks if the longURL already exists in the urlMap, a HashMap storing the mappings of shortURLs and longURLs. If a match is found, the corresponding shortURL is returned. Otherwise, a new shortURL is generated using the generateShortURLFromOriginalURL() method and stored in the urlMap along with the longURL. The shortURL is then returned as the response.

The generateShortURLFromOriginalURL() method generates a shortURL based on the provided longURL. It extracts the characters from the longURL using the extractCharacters() method. It sets the desired length of the shortURL to 6 characters and generates a random shortURL by randomly selecting characters from the extracted characters. The generated shortURL is prefixed with "telus.ko/" and returned.

The extractCharacters() method extracts characters from the longURL. It removes the "https://" and "www." prefixes from the longURL using regular expressions. Then, it removes any non-alphanumeric characters, leaving only letters (both uppercase and lowercase) and digits. If the resulting characters are empty, indicating an invalid URL, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.

Overall, this code demonstrates the implementation of a URL shortening mechanism in a Spring web application. It receives a longURL, checks if it already exists in the urlMap, generates a shortURL if necessary, and maintains the mappings between shortURLs and longURLs.
